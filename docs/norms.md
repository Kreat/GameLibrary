# GameHub Community Norms & Guidelines

## Reliability & Accountability

### 1. Complete your profile before posting
**Why it matters:** People play more reliably when other players feel "human."

**How we enforce this:** You must complete your profile with Display Name, Pronouns, Preferred Game Types, and Time-Zone before hosting or joining game sessions.

### 2. 72-hour RSVP lock
**Why it matters:** Late cancellations waste host prep time.

**How we enforce this:** Players must commit or decline at least 72 hours before game time. Cancellations after this window will count as a "no-show" and affect your reliability score.

### 3. 24-hour host-cancellation rule
**Why it matters:** Hosts must respect players' schedules too.

**How we enforce this:** Hosts who cancel sessions less than 24 hours before start time will receive a reputation penalty.

## Inclusivity & Tone

### 4. Inclusive language / no gate-keeping
**Why it matters:** We want GameHub to be welcoming to players of all experience levels and backgrounds.

**How we enforce this:** Our Code of Conduct prohibits "real gamer" tests, skill shaming, and discriminatory language. Violations may result in warnings or temporary restrictions.

### 5. Attend two sessions before hosting
**Why it matters:** New hosts benefit from observing how others run sessions.

**How we enforce this:** You must participate in at least 2 game sessions before you can host your own.

## Reputation & Feedback

### 6. One-click post-game feedback
**Why it matters:** Simple feedback helps build our reputation system with minimal friction.

**How we enforce this:** After each session, you'll be prompted to provide quick feedback about your experience.

### 7. Beginner-friendly tag
**Why it matters:** Helps new players find welcoming sessions.

**How we enforce this:** Hosts can mark sessions as "Beginner-friendly" to signal that newcomers are welcome.

## Spam & Spoilers

### 8. No multichannel spam
**Why it matters:** Prevents users from flooding multiple forums with identical content.

**How we enforce this:** Posting the same content in more than 2 places will trigger a temporary restriction.

### 9. Spoiler-only threads
**Why it matters:** Protects the experience for players who haven't completed narrative games.

**How we enforce this:** Discussions containing spoilers must be clearly marked and contained in dedicated threads.

## Community Engagement

### 10. Weekly conversation seed
**Why it matters:** Keeps community discussion active and engaging.

**How we enforce this:** We post weekly discussion topics to stimulate conversation in community spaces.
